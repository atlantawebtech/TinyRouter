# TinyRouter

TinyRouter is a very small, and simple PHP class that routes HTTP requests based on the request URI to an anonymous function that you define.  

## Installation
Download the source and place it in your web root. Composer install coming soon.

## Usage
Create an index.php file with the following contents:
```php
<?php

include 'Router.php';

$router = new TinyRouter\Router();

$router->get('/hello/{name}', function($argv) {
    echo 'Hello '.$argv['name'];
});

$router->run();
```

### Defining Routes
There are two types of routes you can define, **GET** routes and **POST** routes.

**GET Route**
```php
$router = new TinyRouter\Router();
$router->get('/hello/{name}', function($argv) {
    echo 'Hello '.$argv['name'];
});
```
**POST Route**
```php
$router = new TinyRouter\Router();
$router->post('/api', function($argv) {
    $this->setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    echo json_encode(array('hello' => 'world'));
});
```
